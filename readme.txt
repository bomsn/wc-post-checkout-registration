Reduce abandonment and allows guest users to register after checkout with one-click.

== Description ==

This plugin provides seamless registration option for your guest customers. When they reach the order confirmation page after checkout, theyâ€™ll be prompted to create an account with a single click, only if they don't have one already.

The plugin will automatically create a user account from the guest details, generate a password for them, logging them in. Moreover, it will trigger a 'new-account' email, and redirect the user to their dashboard.

= How to use =

- Install the plugin and activate it
- Head to WooCommerce settings from WP admin dashboard
- Open the "Accounts & Privacy" tab
- Find and check the "Post-checkout registration" option
- Save changes

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the prompt message? =

Yes, you can. You have the option to set your own message in WC account settings.

= What if I'm using a custom thank you page? =

That's easy, just use the `[wc_pcr_message]` shortcode where you want the prompt to appear. Just make sure to pass the order id in the URL (eg: /?order_id=1), or as a shortcode attribute (eg: [wc_pcr_message order_id="1"])
