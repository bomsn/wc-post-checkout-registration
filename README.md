# One-Click Post Checkout Registration for WooCommerce

## Description ==

This plugin provides seamless registration option for your guest customers. When they reach the order confirmation page after checkout, theyâ€™ll be prompted to create an account with a single click, only if they don't have one already.

The plugin will automatically create a user account from the guest details, generate a password for them, logging them in. Moreover, it will trigger a 'new-account' email, and redirect the user to their dashboard.
